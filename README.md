# ChickenBot

I created this bot to learn how to use Python. I followed a few videos on youtube to learn the function included in Discord.py. It's recommended to run this program on https://repl.it/ to remotely hosted this bot, so it can stayed online.



<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>
  Most of the dependencies can be automatically installed by https://repl.it/ except FFmpeg. <br>
  The user needs to download FFmpeg-git-i686 and placed it in the save folder as main.py
